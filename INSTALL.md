## Option 1: Development Installation (Recommended)

Add the repository to your Flarum installation and install as a development package:

```bash
# Navigate to your Flarum root directory
cd /path/to/your/flarum

# Add the repository
composer config repositories.flarum-rich-text-editor vcs https://github.com/sdacleofe/flarum-ext

# Install the extension

```

## Option 2: Manual Installation
